Today I went to the Ethical Hacking conference with my boss. It was my first
appearance at such conferences, but I hope there will be more. Although we
just started to redesign our IT security infrastructure with a 90% clear goal,
it was nice to hear that everything is vulnerable. I was thinking if we should
sell all our IT equipments, fire all our colleagues (you know, to prevent
social engineering), and move to the South Americas to herd llamas or sheep,
so the only danger would be some lurking pumas or jaguars. Or I simply leave
my old background image on my desktop, from the well-known game, which says:
Trust is a weakness.

Anyways, the conference was really nice. We heard about the weaknesses of
Android, Oracle, and even FireWire. They showed some demos about everything,
exploited some free and commercial software with no problem at all. We have
seen how much power the virtualisation admin has (although I think it can be
prevented, but I’m not sure yet). However, in the end, we could see that the
Cloud is secure (or at least it can be, in a few months or so), so I’m not
totally pessimistic. See you next time at Hacktivity!
