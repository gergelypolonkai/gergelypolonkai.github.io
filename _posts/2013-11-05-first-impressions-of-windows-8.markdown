Many of you may know my commitment to Linux and Open Source Software. But this
doesn’t mean I hate proprietary software like many others do. I think
everything has its own place in the world, and this goes for software as well.

A few days ago I got my hands on a new notebook, thanks to my company. It was
shipped with Windows 8 by default, and although I installed Fedora 19 in an
instant (which went smoothlessly, even with Secure Boot enabled), I’ve decided
to give a try to this new Windows Version.

Being a heavy Windows 7 user, my first thought was “What the hell is this?”
But in a day, I got totally used to it. I don’t miss the Start button at all.
The applications already installed were almost enough for me (I still need
Office. Maybe I’ll also enroll for Office 365 later…), and the games are great
and beautiful too. So overall, this new version may be totally different (by
the looks), but it seems almost the same Windows as we know it. So if you
don’t freak out by touching something new, go give it a try: don’t
instant-remove 8 in favour of 7!
