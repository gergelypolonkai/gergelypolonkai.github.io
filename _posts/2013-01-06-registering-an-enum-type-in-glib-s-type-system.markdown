I faced a problem in my [GLib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/) self-teaching
project, [wMUD](https://github.com/gergelypolonkai/wmud) today. I wanted to
register a signal for a `GObject`, whose handler should accept two `enum`
parameters for which I had to register a new `GEnum` type in the `GObject` type
system. However, the [documentation on this
feature](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/unstable/gtype-non-instantiable.html)
(thanks for pointing out goes to hashem on `#gnome-hackers`) is not… uhm…
obvious. Making the long story short, I have checked with the `GIO` sources for
an example, and using that, I have created this small, working chunk:

{% gist gergelypolonkai/47794b6fb94484f8160b client-state.h %}

{% gist gergelypolonkai/47794b6fb94484f8160b client-state.c %}

Still, it can be made more perfect by using the
[glib-mkenums](http://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/glib-mkenums.html)
tool. I will read through the GLib Makefiles tomorrow for some hints on
this.

Edit: you can find the glib-mkenums solution [here]({% post_url 2014-08-16-registering-an-enum-type-in-glib-glib-mkenums-magic %}).
