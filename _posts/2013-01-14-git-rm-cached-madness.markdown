I have recently learned about `git rm --cached`. Itâ€™s a very good tool, as it
removes a file from tracking, without removing your local copy of it. However,
be warned that if you use `git pull` in another working copy, the file will be
removed from there! If you accidentally put the configuration of a production
project, and remove it on your dev machine, it can cause a lot of trouble ;)
