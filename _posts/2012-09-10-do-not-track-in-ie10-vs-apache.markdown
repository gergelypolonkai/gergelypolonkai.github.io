[Apache developer decided not to accept Do-Not-Track headers from IE10
users](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/apache-webserver-updated-to-ignore-do-not-track-settings-in-ie-10/),
because it’s enabled by default. So… if I install a plugin that hides the
fact from the web server that I’m using IE10, I become eligible of using
it. But if I do this, I simply became eligible because I consciously installed
that addon, so I could actually use it without hiding the fact. Sorry if
I’m a bit Philosoraptorish…
