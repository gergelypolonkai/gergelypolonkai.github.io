Today I got an interesting task. I had to upload some pdf documents to a site.
The domain is ours, but we don’t have access to the application server that is
hosting the page yet. Until we get it in our hands, I did a trick.

I enabled `mod_rewrite`, `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_http`, then added the following
lines to my apache config:

{% gist gergelypolonkai/47680bfa44eb29708f20 %}

I’m not totally sure it’s actually secure, but it works for now.
