I have recently bumped into [this
article](http://spot.livejournal.com/308370.html). Naturally, I quickly
calculated the FAIL metrics for all my projects (most of them are pretty high).
To ease calculation, I made up a
[small page]({{ '/failmeter/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) based on this list
(although I have divided the points by 5; I really don’t understand why spot is
using such big points if all of them can be divided by 5). Feel free to use it,
and if you have any recommendations (point additions/removal, new categories,
etc.), leave me a comment!
