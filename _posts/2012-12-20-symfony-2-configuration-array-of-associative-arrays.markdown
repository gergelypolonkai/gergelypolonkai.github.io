Few days ago I have struggled with a problem using Symfony2 configuration. I
wanted to add the following kind of configuration to `config.yml`:

{% gist gergelypolonkai/30440e25f7a447730064 config.yml %}

The problem was that the stuff under `transitions` is dynamic, so those
`hc_cba` and `cba_hc` tags can be pretty much anything. After hitting many
errors, I came to the solution:

{% gist gergelypolonkai/30440e25f7a447730064 DynarrayConfiguration.php %}
