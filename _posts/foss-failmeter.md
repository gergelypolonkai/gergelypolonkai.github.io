I have recently bumped into [this
article](http://spot.livejournal.com/308370.html). Naturally, I quickly
calculated the FAIL metrics for all my projects (most of them are pretty high).
To ease calculation, I made up a small page based on this list (although I have
divided the points by 5; I really donâ€™t understand why spot is using such big
points if all of them can be divided by 5). Feel free to use it, and if you
have any recommendations (point additions/removal, new categories, etc.), leave
me a comment!
