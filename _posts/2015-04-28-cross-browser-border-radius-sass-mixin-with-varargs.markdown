Few days ago I needed to create style sheets with many rounded boxes,
where different corners had to be rounded differently (think about
Bootstrapâ€™s [button
groups](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups)).

CSS has this nifty shorthand to specify border width in one line, like
with `border-width: 1px 2px 3px 4px`, but it lacks the same for
`border-radius`. So I decided to create something similar using [Sass
mixins](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-6) with dynamic
parameters. Another nice feature you get using the `border-width`
shorthand is that you can specify less than four parameters, and the
values will be applied on different sides of your box, so in the end
all side will have a `border-witdh` set.

I wanted to achieve the same for my `border-radius` mixin, although I
could not start specifically with the `top` side. I decided to go with
the top right corner for the first parameter, while trying to keep a
sane repeting pattern. Here is the result:
